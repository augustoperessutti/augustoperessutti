Hi there! My name is Augusto, I'm from Argentina but I currently live in MÃ¡laga, Spain. I'm Junior Full Stack Web Developer and this is my humble repository.

## ðŸš€&nbsp; My motivations

Since I finished the Full Stack Web Developer course at the Upgrade Hub academy, my unique motivation is to find a new job where I can continue learning and developing my self as programmer. A place where the goal is to make a difference.

## ðŸ“š&nbsp; What I know

I studied and work with HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, React, Angular, NodeJs, PHP, Symfony, MySQL, Mongodb, Docker and more! My favorite lenaguage is JavaScript. I think the ideal mix and where I would like to be an expert is MERN Stack. I really like how React works with the components and also the combination of Node and Mongo.

## ðŸ“«&nbsp; Have a question? Do you want to contact me?
